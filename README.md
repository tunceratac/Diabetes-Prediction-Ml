Handling features engineering topics to diabetes.csv

It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA.
Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.
The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

- Pregnancies: number of pregnancies
- Glucose: 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness
- Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that calculates the probability of having diabetes based on descendants
- BMI: Body mass index
- Age
- Outcome: Have the disease (1) or not (0)
